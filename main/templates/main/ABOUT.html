                                    <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Since 1963, the mission of The Methodist
                                        Foundation for Arkansas has been to create and administer permanent charitable
                                        endowment funds to strengthen and expand Methodist ministries in Arkansas. By
                                        offering financial resources, we empower Arkansas Methodist churches,
                                        individuals, and organizations to make a difference in the lives of others.<br>
                                        <br>Today, The Methodist Foundation for Arkansas is grateful to its past,
                                        vision, and leadership from those who have gone and given before us. They have
                                        inspired us and taught us. We pray you will join us in this seed-planting
                                        business.

                                    <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-6"> The Methodist Foundation for Arkansas
                                        began in 1963 with a group of Methodists who had a vision for the ongoing
                                        support of the church in Arkansas (formerly The United Methodist Foundation of
                                        Arkansas). They wanted to create a plan that would fund the needs of Methodist
                                        ministries in Arkansas forever.<br>
                                        <br>Inspired by their initial work, Jim Argue, Jr., then-President and CEO,
                                        joined the Foundation in 1981 when assets were $100,000. He began in a borrowed
                                        office with donated tools. Still, he steadily built the Foundation's assets
                                        through relationships with Methodists who wanted their support of the church to
                                        last beyond their lifetimes.<br>
                                        <br>Generations of donors have made The Methodist Foundation for Arkansas a
                                        beneficiary of their planned and outright gifts, building the total assets to
                                        over $190 million in 2020. Today the Foundation is one of the largest in the
                                        U.S. We manage over 800 accounts, have a nine-person staff, and are supported by
                                        a network of consultants and advisors who assist us in audit, investments, legal
                                        affairs, and technology.<br>
                                        <br>The Foundation makes grants in areas of clergy and lay leadership, hunger,
                                        children's ministries, seminary scholarships, outdoor ministries, and much more.<br>
                                        <br>Throughout its history, The Methodist Foundation for Arkansas has remained
                                        focused on our founding members' vision as we help Methodists from around our
                                        state create charitable endowments that will enhance Methodist ministries for
                                        generations to come.
